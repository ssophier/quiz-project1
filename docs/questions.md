### **ðŸŽ¯ Content Strategy**


**When someone sees your content for the first time, what happens next?**

**They like/comment and that's it (I hope they follow)**

**I tell them to "DM me for more info"**

**I have a link in bio to book a call**

**I offer a specific free resource that captures their email**

**How often do you post content specifically designed to generate leads (not just engagement)?**

**Never - I focus on valuable content and hope people reach out**

**Occasionally - maybe once a week**

**Regularly - 2-3 times per week**

**Strategically - every post has a purpose in my client journey**


### **ðŸ§² Lead Capture**


**What free resource do you offer to capture contact information?**

**Nothing - I rely on social media followers**

**Generic PDF guide or checklist**

**Specific resource that solves one problem**

**Interactive tool/assessment that provides personalized results**

**How many email subscribers do you get per 1000 content views?**

**I don't track this / Less than 5**

**5-15 subscribers**

**15-30 subscribers**

**30+ subscribers**

### **ðŸ’Œ Nurture System**

**What happens after someone downloads your free resource?**

**They get the resource and that's it**

**They go on my general newsletter list**

**They get 2-3 follow-up emails with more value**

**They enter a strategic sequence that builds trust and positions my services**

**How do you stay in touch with prospects who aren't ready to buy yet?**

**I don't - I hope they see my social media posts**

**Occasional newsletter when I remember**

**Regular newsletter with business tips**

**Strategic email sequence + regular value-driven content**

### **ðŸ’° Conversion Process**

**How do prospects typically book a call with you?**

**They have to DM me or email me directly**

**Generic "book a call" link in bio**

**Dedicated booking page with clear value proposition**

**Multi-step process that pre-qualifies and warms them up first**

**What percentage of your discovery calls convert to clients?**

**Less than 30% (or I don't track this)**

**30-50%**

**50-70%**

**70%+ (because only qualified prospects book calls)**

1. How often do people who engage with your content end up booking a call or making a purchase?

Occasionally - maybe 1-2 clients from hundreds of interactions

Regularly - I can trace most clients back to my content
